# The valuation at infinity on the function field of a Weierstrass curve

The function field `F(W)` of an affine Weierstrass curve is a quadratic extension of the rational
function field `F(x)` (`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finrank_functionField`), so every function has an
algebra norm there. Composing that norm with Mathlib's place at infinity of `F(x)` gives the place
at infinity of the curve: `ord_∞ f = -deg N f`, the place where `x` and `y` have their poles.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace`: the valuation at infinity,
  `Valuation W.FunctionField (WithZero (Multiplicative ℤ))`, as `RatFunc.inftyValuation` composed
  with `Algebra.norm`.

## Main results

The valuation's `map_add_le_max'` rests on an ultrametric inequality in degree form, proved here;
the other three axioms are the norm's multiplicativity and Mathlib's place at infinity.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace.X`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace.mk_Y`: `v_∞ x = exp 2` and `v_∞ y = exp 3` — the double
  and triple poles at infinity, `ord_∞ x = -2` and `ord_∞ y = -3`, which is what Layer 0 asks for
  by name. They read this file's two `natDegree_norm_*` helpers through
  `Algebra.norm_localization` and Mathlib's polynomial valuation.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace.algebraMap_eq_sq`: restricting along
  `RatFunc F → W.FunctionField` squares `RatFunc.inftyValuation`, so the place at infinity is
  ramified of index two over the infinite place of `F(x)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace.C`: the valuation is trivial on the base field — a
  nonzero constant has value `1`, the constant case of the previous result. The
  `Valuation.IsTrivialOn F` and `Valuation.IsNontrivial` instances follow, so the place is usable
  through Mathlib's standard valuation API.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace.X_div_mk_Y` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace.isUniformizer_X_div_mk_Y`: **`x / y` is a uniformiser at
  infinity.** Its value is `exp (-1)`, and it is a uniformiser in Mathlib's
  `Valuation.IsUniformizer` sense. That the place is discrete of rank one needs no proof here — its
  value group is a nontrivial subgroup of the cyclic `ℤᵐ⁰ˣ`, so Mathlib's `IsRankOneDiscrete`
  instance fires by itself — but the *generator* does: discreteness alone permits `exp (-n)` with
  `n ≥ 1`, and the proper subgroup `2ℤ` genuinely occurs, being the value group of the restriction
  of `v_∞` to `F(x)`. One element of value `exp (-1)` settles it, which is what the value above is.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.infinityPlace_ne_heightOneSpectrum_valuation`: the place at infinity is
  distinct from the valuation of every height-one prime of the coordinate ring — the affine places.
  With `CoordinateRing.pointPlace_eq_iff` that makes the whole point-to-place assignment injective,
  the point at infinity included.

The two coordinate-function values each come in a second `@[simp]` form, stated in the shape simp
actually normalises them to (the note above `infinityPlace.X` explains why the coordinate forms
cannot carry the tag themselves). The quotient value gets no restatement of its own: `map_div₀`
is a simp lemma, so simp decomposes the quotient through the two atomic restatements. The
machinery that builds the ultrametric inequality is `private`, and the norm-degree theory it
rests on lives in `FunctionField/Norm.lean`.

## Roadmap

`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, **Layer 0** (the function field, places, and divisors),
whose §Places asks for the one further place `W.infinityPlace` beyond the affine ones, sitting
"where `x` and `y` have their poles", with `ord_∞ x = -2`, `ord_∞ y = -3`. This file supplies the
valuation, those two degrees, and the **uniformiser** `x / y` — §Places lists "`ord_v`,
uniformisers, residue fields, the degree `deg v`" as the API the later layers consume.
`Suggested.lean` seeds no declaration it competes with, recording that the function-field layer's
"types are new API and are built there, not pinned here".

## Provenance

The route is that of the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0,
`dev/hasse-weil` at `a582951fe96b`), `HasseWeil/Curves/Infinity.lean`: `normAsRatFunc`,
`ordAtInfty`, `ordAtInfty_mul`, `ordAtInfty_add_ge_min` (tagged T-ORD-ARITH-12) and
`ordAtInfty_coordX`/`ordAtInfty_coordY`.

The ramification statement corresponds to that project's `Curves/OrdAtInftyRamification.lean` and
`Curves/RamificationAtInfinity.lean`; there it is an order identity for a `WithTop ℤ`-valued
`ordAtInfty` over the `SmoothPlaneCurve` wrapper, where here it is an equality of Mathlib
`Valuation`s and follows from `Algebra.norm_algebraMap` with `finrank_functionField`.

Changes from the source. There `ordAtInfty` is a definition of its own, valued in `WithTop ℤ`, built
over a `SmoothPlaneCurve` structure wrapping `WeierstrassCurve.Affine`, with multiplicativity,
vanishing and the ultrametric bound all proved by hand. Here the norm is Mathlib's `Algebra.norm`
and the target is Mathlib's `ℤᵐ⁰`, so the result is a genuine `Valuation` uniform with
`RatFunc.inftyValuation` and `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuation`; multiplicativity and
vanishing are `map_mul` and `Algebra.norm_zero`, and only the ultrametric inequality is
reproved.

The uniformiser corresponds to that project's
`projects/HasseWeil/HasseWeil/Foundation/LocalExpansion.lean` at `main` `1c1c7466`, `localParam` —
the local parameter `t = -x/y` at `O` (Silverman IV.1) — whose uniformising property is recorded
there through a Laurent-series embedding (`localExpand_localParam`), over a `SmoothPlaneCurve` and
that development's own `WithTop ℤ`-valued `ordAtInfty`. None of that apparatus is needed here: the
value of `x / y` is two rewrites from the two pole orders, and Mathlib's
`Valuation.IsRankOneDiscrete.generator_eq_exp_neg_one_of_mem_range` turns that single value into the
generator, so the conclusion is Mathlib's `Valuation.IsUniformizer` directly. The sign is dropped,
`x / y` and `-x / y` having the same valuation.
