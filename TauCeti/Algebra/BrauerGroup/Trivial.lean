# Brauer triviality

Two finite-dimensional central simple `K`-algebras are **Brauer equivalent** when they become
isomorphic after passing to matrix algebras over them (Mathlib's `IsBrauerEquivalent`), and
`BrauerGroup K` is the quotient of `CSA K` by that relation. Mathlib stops there: the quotient
carries no group structure yet, and `TauCeti/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Basic.lean` supplies the
constructors and the two moves that leave a Brauer class unchanged. This file builds the part of
the theory the identity element of that group will rest on -- which algebras are **Brauer
trivial**, that is, equivalent to `K` itself -- and reads off the first two computations of a
Brauer group.

The engine is a single observation. An algebra **split by `K`**, in the sense of
`TauCeti.Algebra.IsSplittingField`, is a matrix algebra `Mₚ(K)`, and any two matrix algebras over
`K` become isomorphic after one more round of matrices: `Mᵩ(Mₚ(K))` and `Mₚ(Mᵩ(K))` are both the
matrix algebra over `K` indexed by a product of `Fin p` and `Fin q`, in the two orders, and
transposing the two factors matches them up. So the algebras split by `K` form a *single* Brauer
class, and each of the three named Brauer-trivial algebras is trivial because it is already known
to be a matrix algebra over `K`: a full matrix algebra `Mₙ(K)` by definition, the endomorphism
algebra `End_K V` of a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space by a choice of basis
(`TauCeti.Algebra.endAlgEquivMatrix`), and `A ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` for a finite-dimensional central simple
`A` by the Azumaya isomorphism (`TauCeti.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix`).

The last of these is why the Brauer group will have inverses: it says the class of `Aᵐᵒᵖ` is
inverse to the class of `A`, once the multiplication induced by `⊗[K]` is known to descend to
classes.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsBrauerTrivial`: Brauer equivalence to the base field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isBrauerEquivalent_of_isSplittingField`: **two algebras split by `K` are Brauer
  equivalent**, with `TauCeti.isBrauerTrivial_of_isSplittingField` the form having the base field
  on one side.
* `TauCeti.isBrauerTrivial_matrix`, `TauCeti.isBrauerTrivial_end` and
  `TauCeti.isBrauerTrivial_tensorOp`: the three Brauer-trivial algebras named above.
* `TauCeti.subsingleton_brauerGroup_of_forall_isSplittingField`: **a field splitting every
  central simple algebra over it has trivial Brauer group**, from which
  `TauCeti.subsingleton_brauerGroup_of_isAlgClosed` and
  `TauCeti.subsingleton_brauerGroup_of_finite`: **the Brauer group of an algebraically closed
  field, and of a finite field, is trivial.**

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.IsBrauerTrivial` compares an algebra with `TauCeti.CSA.base K`, so it is stated for a
`CSA.{u, u} K`, an algebra in the universe of its own base field. That is not a restriction on the
mathematics -- a finite-dimensional `K`-algebra has a model in `Type u` -- but Mathlib's
`IsBrauerEquivalent` relates two algebras in one universe, and `K` lives in `Type u`. The
statements that do not mention `K` itself as an algebra, including the two Brauer-group
computations, stay at the full generality of `BrauerGroup.{u, v}`.

The two splitting facts `TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_end` and
`TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_tensorOp` are proved here rather than with the rest of the
splitting API, because they consume the simplicity of an endomorphism algebra and the Azumaya
isomorphism, which sit above `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Splitting.lean` in the import order.

The converse of `TauCeti.isBrauerTrivial_of_isSplittingField` -- that a Brauer-trivial algebra is
split -- is **not** proved here, and is not a formal consequence of these lemmas: it needs the
uniqueness of the Wedderburn data, which sits above this file in the import order. It is
`TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_self_of_isBrauerTrivial`, in
`TauCeti/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Splitting.lean`. Nothing below uses it, and in particular the two
Brauer-group computations go through the splitting side only.

Over an algebra in the universe of `K` this is the statement wanted downstream; the version for two

in `Type u`, is `TauCeti.isBrauerEquivalent_of_isSplittingField`. -/

Any two such algebras are Brauer equivalent by

a different property of `K`. -/

central simple algebra over an algebraically closed field is a matrix algebra over it

Wedderburn), so the Wedderburn presentation of a central simple algebra over a finite field is
already a matrix algebra over that field (`TauCeti.Algebra.isSplittingField_self_of_finite`); again
there is only one Brauer class. -/
