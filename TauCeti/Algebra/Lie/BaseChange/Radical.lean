# Solvability, nilpotency and semisimplicity under extension of scalars

Let `L` be a Lie algebra over a commutative ring `R` and let `A` be an `R`-algebra.  Mathlib's
`LieSubmodule.baseChange` extends an ideal `I` of `L` to the ideal `I.baseChange A` of `A ⊗[R] L`,
and `LieAlgebra.derivedSeriesOfIdeal_baseChange` computes the derived series of an extended ideal
by extending the derived series term by term.  This file records the same statement for the series
`L ≥ ⁅I, L⁆ ≥ ⁅I, ⁅I, L⁆⁆ ≥ ⋯` that measures nilpotency of an ideal, and reads both series off as
transfer principles:

```text
IsSolvable ↥(I.baseChange A) ↔ IsSolvable ↥I,   IsNilpotent ↥(I.baseChange A) ↔ IsNilpotent ↥I
```

Ascent — transferring either property from `I` to `I.baseChange A` — asks nothing of `A`.  Descent,
the `→` direction of the equivalences as displayed, is exactly where faithful flatness enters,
through `Submodule.baseChange_inj`: a term of either series can vanish after extending scalars
only if it vanished already.  Applied to the two largest ideals, ascent gives

```text
(radical R L).baseChange A ≤ radical A (A ⊗[R] L),
(nilradical R L).baseChange A ≤ nilradical A (A ⊗[R] L).
```

Neither containment is forced to be an equality by the transfer principles, because an ideal of
`A ⊗[R] L` need not be extended from `L` at all, and nothing above bounds the ideals that are
not.  The case where both sides are `⊥` is the separate statement
`LieAlgebra.hasTrivialRadical_baseChange_iff`: over a field of characteristic zero a
finite-dimensional Lie algebra has trivial radical exactly when some extension of scalars of it to a
field extension, or more generally to a principal ideal domain, does,
so extending scalars can neither destroy nor *create* a solvable ideal of a semisimple algebra.

For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero the containment is an
equality: `LieAlgebra.radical_baseChange` says the radical commutes with extension of scalars to a
field extension, or any principal ideal domain, and
`LieAlgebra.one_tmul_mem_radical_baseChange_iff` reads that as a criterion, so membership in the
radical may be tested after extending scalars.  The corresponding statement for the nilradical is
*not* proved here and does not follow, since `L ⧸ nilradical K L` need not have trivial
nilradical.

## Main results

* `LieIdeal.lcs_baseChange`: the series `⁅I, ⁅I, … ⁅I, M⁆…⁆⁆` commutes with extension of scalars.
* `LieIdeal.isSolvable_baseChange_iff` and `LieIdeal.isNilpotent_baseChange_iff`: **an ideal is
  solvable, respectively nilpotent, exactly when its faithfully flat extension of scalars is.**
* `LieAlgebra.baseChange_radical_le` and `LieAlgebra.baseChange_nilradical_le`: the extension of
  the radical, respectively of the nilradical, lands in the radical, respectively the nilradical,
  of the extended algebra.
* `LieAlgebra.hasTrivialRadical_baseChange_iff`: **in characteristic zero a finite-dimensional Lie
  algebra has trivial radical exactly when its extension to a field extension, or any principal
  ideal domain, does.**
* `LieAlgebra.radical_baseChange`: **in characteristic zero the solvable radical of a
  finite-dimensional Lie algebra commutes with extension of scalars to a field extension, or any
  principal ideal domain**, with
  `LieAlgebra.one_tmul_mem_radical_baseChange_iff` reading it as a membership criterion that may
  be checked after extending scalars.

/-- **Triviality of the radical is insensitive to extension of scalars to a principal ideal
domain**, such as a field extension.  In characteristic zero a finite-dimensional Lie algebra has
trivial radical exactly when its extension of scalars to such a domain does.

The `←` direction is the substantive one: it says that extending scalars cannot *create* a
solvable ideal.  Neither direction follows from `LieIdeal.isSolvable_baseChange_iff`, which only
speaks of ideals extended from `L`.  Characteristic zero is a genuine hypothesis here, not a
convenience. -/

the radical of `A ⊗[K] L` is the extension of scalars of the radical of `L`.

Characteristic zero is a genuine hypothesis, not a convenience.  The equality determines the
radical of `A ⊗[K] L` completely, although it says nothing about individual solvable ideals of
`A ⊗[K] L`, which need not themselves be extended from `L`; as a test for membership in the
radical it is `LieAlgebra.one_tmul_mem_radical_baseChange_iff`. -/
