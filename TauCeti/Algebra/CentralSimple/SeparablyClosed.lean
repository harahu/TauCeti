# Central simple algebras over separably closed fields

A finite-dimensional central simple algebra over a separably closed field is a full matrix
algebra.  This strengthens the algebraically closed case used in the initial splitting-field API
and is the field-theoretic input for refining an arbitrary finite splitting extension to a finite
separable one.

The only extra issue over the algebraically closed proof is the coefficient division algebra in
Artin--Wedderburn.  If a finite-dimensional central division algebra `D` over a separably closed
field `K` were larger than `K`, the Jacobson--Noether theorem would produce an element of `D`
outside `K` that is separable over `K`.  Its irreducible minimal polynomial would have degree one,
because `K` is separably closed, so the element would in fact lie in `K`, a contradiction.

The scalar-extension and splitting consequences live in
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Degree.lean` and
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Splitting.lean`, where they replace the former algebraically closed
special cases.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.baseFieldAlgEquivOfIsSepClosed`: a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a
  separably closed field is the base field.
* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.exists_algEquiv_matrix_of_isSepClosed`: a finite-dimensional central simple
  algebra over a separably closed field is a full matrix algebra.

/-- An element of a domain that is separable over a separably closed base field belongs
to the image of that base field.

The minimal polynomial is irreducible because the ambient algebra is a domain.  It is
separable by hypothesis, hence has degree one over a separably closed field. The degree-one
calculation adapts Mathlib's `IsSepClosed.algebraMap_surjective` from a field extension to a single
element of a possibly noncommutative domain. -/
