# The annulus conjecture

Two disjoint locally flat `n`-spheres in `ℝⁿ⁺¹`, one inside the region bounded by the other,
cobound a closed region homeomorphic to `Sⁿ × [0, 1]`. This is the **annulus conjecture**, now a
theorem in every dimension. The whole content is that the region between the spheres is a product;
it fails without local flatness, since a wild sphere such as the Alexander horned sphere need not
bound a ball on its wild side, let alone an annulus together with a round sphere.

The regions are read off with `TauCeti.filledHull`, the set together with the bounded components
of its complement. For an embedded sphere `f` in `ℝⁿ⁺¹` the complement has exactly one bounded
component by the Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem, so `filledHull (range f) \ range f` is the open
region the sphere bounds, and `filledHull (range f)` is its closure. The closed region between the
outer sphere `f` and an inner sphere `g` is then
`filledHull (range f) \ (filledHull (range g) \ range g)`: everything enclosed by `f`, minus what
lies strictly inside `g`. No separation theorem is assumed; the definitions make sense for arbitrary
subsets, and the separation is part of what the conjecture's conclusion asserts.

`TauCeti.CoboundAnnulus f g` says that this closed region is the image of an embedding of
`X × [0, 1]` restricting to `f` and `g` at the two ends, up to reparametrization: the end
`X × {0}` is carried onto the image of `f`, and the end `X × {1}` onto the image of `g`. The
conjecture itself, `TauCeti.AnnulusConjecture n`, is recorded as a dimension-indexed proposition in
the manner of `TauCeti.BrownBicollaring`, with the same indexing: `n` is the dimension of the
spheres, which sit in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n + 1))`, and local flatness is read in the split
model `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) × ℝ`. Kirby's theorem is the case `n + 1 ≥ 5`, and Quinn's the case
`n + 1 = 4`.

The round case is proved here, which shows that the hypotheses of the conjecture can hold and that
its conclusion is attained: scaling the unit sphere by `c ≠ 0` is locally flat
(`TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_smul_coe_sphere`), for `0 < r < R` the sphere of radius `r` lies inside the
sphere of radius `R` (`TauCeti.range_smul_coe_sphere_subset_filledHull_sdiff`), and the two
concentric spheres cobound the closed annulus `{r ≤ ‖x‖ ≤ R}`
(`TauCeti.coboundAnnulus_smul_coe_sphere`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.CoboundAnnulus`: two maps cobound an annulus.
* `TauCeti.AnnulusConjecture`: two nested locally flat `n`-spheres in `ℝⁿ⁺¹` cobound an annulus.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isLocallyFlat_smul_coe_sphere`: a rescaled unit sphere is locally flat, with
  one-dimensional complementary model.
* `TauCeti.range_smul_coe_sphere_subset_filledHull_sdiff`: a smaller concentric sphere lies inside
  a larger one.
* `TauCeti.coboundAnnulus_smul_coe_sphere`: two concentric round spheres cobound an annulus.

/-- The maps `f g : X → E` **cobound an annulus** if the designated region between their images,
the filled hull of `range f` with the part strictly inside `range g` removed, is the image of an
embedding `X × [0, 1] → E` carrying the end `X × {0}` onto `range f` and the end `X × {1}` onto
`range g`. For spheres `f` and `g` this says that the region between them is homeomorphic to the
product of a sphere and an interval, with the two boundary spheres as its two ends. -/

/-- **The annulus conjecture for `n`-spheres in `ℝⁿ⁺¹`:** if `f` and `g` are locally flat
embeddings of the standard `n`-sphere in `ℝⁿ⁺¹` and the image of `g` lies in the open region
bounded by the image of `f`, then `f` and `g` cobound an annulus.

Local flatness is read in the model `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) × ℝ`, so each sphere is locally a
codimension-one coordinate slice. The region bounded by `f` is `filledHull (range f) \ range f`,
which also forces the two images to be disjoint. -/
