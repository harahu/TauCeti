# The width of a filled hull

The filled hull `TauCeti.filledHull K` — `K` together with the bounded connected components of its
complement — is defined in `TauCeti/Topology/FilledHull.lean`, where it needs only a topology and a
bornology. In a real normed space the one substantial fact is that filling does not make a set
wider:

> `TauCeti.filledHull_subset_closedConvexHull` — `filledHull K ⊆ closedConvexHull ℝ K`,

whence `TauCeti.diam_filledHull`: a set and its filled hull have the same diameter. The
mechanism is separation: a point `x` outside the closed convex hull of `K` is cut off
from it by a continuous linear functional (`geometric_hahn_banach_point_closed`), and the open
half-space `{y | φ y < u}` so produced is a convex — hence preconnected — subset of `Kᶜ` containing
`x`, and it is unbounded (`TauCeti.not_isBounded_halfSpace_lt`). So the component of `x` in `Kᶜ` is
unbounded and `x` is not in the filled hull. Nonemptiness of `K` is needed only to know that
`φ ≠ 0`; for `K = ∅` and a zero-dimensional space the convex-hull statement is false, the hull then
being everything and the convex hull empty. The diameter statements survive that case
unhypothesised, because `filledHull ∅` is empty in a nontrivial space
(`TauCeti.filledHull_empty`) and the single point of the zero space otherwise, of diameter `0`
either way.

Because the width of a filled hull is controlled, so is that of anything inside it, and the shape
in which this is spent is `IsPreconnected.subset_filledHull`: a preconnected set disjoint from `K`
is trapped inside the filled hull as soon as it meets it. Their composite,
`IsPreconnected.diam_le_diam_of_disjoint`, says that *a connected set that a small `K` cuts off
from infinity is itself small*, with no regularity asked of `K`.

## Roadmap role

The filled hull is the vocabulary in which the enclosure step of layer **L5** of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md` is stated. That step is now unconditional: the
preconnectedness/winding-number route in `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/Inside.lean`
places one image piece of a crosscut in the filled hull without plane separation. In the diameter
bound that follows, `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Crosscut/SmallJordanCurve.lean` encloses a
short image crosscut in an arbitrarily small Jordan curve `J`, and
`IsPreconnected.diam_le_diam_of_disjoint` makes the cut-off piece no wider than `J`.

This is a different route to a diameter bound from `TauCeti.diam_le_diam_of_frontier_subset` of
`TauCeti/Analysis/Normed/Module/DiamFrontier.lean`, which bounds a set by *any* bounded set
containing its frontier: there the enclosing set must be known to contain the whole frontier, here
only that the set is cut off from infinity. The frontier route is the special case of the enclosure
route obtained from `TauCeti.subset_filledHull_of_frontier_subset`; the enclosure route does not
require the whole frontier to be caught.

## Generality

The width statements are stated for an arbitrary real normed space — nothing about the plane is
used, and the separation argument is the general Hahn–Banach one.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.filledHull_subset_closedConvexHull` — a filled hull lies in the closed convex hull.
* `TauCeti.diam_filledHull` and `TauCeti.isBounded_filledHull` — filling preserves the diameter, and
  a filled hull is bounded exactly when the set filled is.
* `TauCeti.diam_le_diam_of_subset_filledHull` and
  `IsPreconnected.diam_le_diam_of_disjoint` — a set inside the filled hull of a bounded `K`,
  in particular a preconnected set that `K` cuts off from infinity, is no wider than `K`.
* `TauCeti.filledHull_sphere` — filling a sphere gives the closed ball.
* `TauCeti.isBounded_closedConvexHull`,
  `TauCeti.diam_closedConvexHull` — the closed forms of the two convex-hull facts the width
  argument runs on.
* `TauCeti.connectedComponentIn_compl_eq_of_unbounded_component` — the unbounded connected
  component of the complement of a bounded set is unique (dimension at least two).
* `TauCeti.mem_filledHull_or_mem_filledHull_of_notMem_connectedComponentIn` — of two points in
  different components, at least one lies in the filled hull (dimension at least two).
