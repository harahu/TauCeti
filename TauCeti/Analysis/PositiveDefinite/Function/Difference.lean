# Differences of bounded positive-definite functions

On an involutive commutative additive monoid `M`, a *bounded* positive-definite function `F`
dominates each of its translates by a self-adjoint element: if `star s = s`, then

`x ↦ F x - F (x + s)`

is again positive definite. This is the function-level form of
`TauCeti.posSemidef_sub_comp_shift`; self-adjointness of `s` is exactly what makes translation by
`s` a symmetric shift of the kernel `(a, b) ↦ F (a + star b)`.

That difference is the negative of Mathlib's forward difference `Δ_[s] F`, so iterating gives that
the alternating iterated differences `(-1) ^ n Δ_[s]^[n] F` are positive definite too, in operator
form and in the explicit binomial form

`x ↦ ∑ k ≤ n, (-1) ^ k (n choose k) F (x + k • s)`.

Positive definiteness is a statement about quadratic forms, not a pointwise sign; the values
themselves are nonnegative at the "norm points" `a + star a`.

Boundedness is only ever assumed at the "norm points" `a + star a`, the diagonal of the kernel:
Cauchy--Schwarz propagates a bound there to every point of the form `p + star q`. It is essential
and is not a technical artefact: `t ↦ exp t` is positive definite on the involutive monoid
`(ℝ≥0, +)` with the trivial involution, and it *increases*. The statement is
proved by a purely numerical moment-problem estimate on the finite quadratic forms; no topology,
measurability, or representing measure is assumed or produced here.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/OneParameterSemigroups/README.md`, Part C: it is the closure property
of the generic `IsPositiveDefinite` predicate that the Berg--Christensen--Ressel representation
(Milestone 2) runs on. The zero-spatial time axis `t ↦ F (t, 0)` of a bounded positive-definite
function on `ℝ≥0 × V` is such a function, for the trivial involution on `ℝ≥0`, and
`TauCeti/Analysis/PositiveDefinite/SemigroupGroup/Time/Difference.lean` reads its complete
monotonicity off the results below. The two-variable statements on `ℝ≥0 × V` itself are *not*
instances of them — the involutive-monoid wrapper carrying the Berg--Christensen--Ressel involution
is private to `TauCeti/Analysis/PositiveDefinite/SemigroupGroup/Basic.lean` — and are proved there
from the Kolmogorov decomposition of the Berg--Christensen--Ressel kernel; only the
forward-difference bookkeeping below is shared.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.neg_one_pow_mul_fwdDiff_iter_succ`: one differencing step advances the alternating
  iterated forward difference by one.
* `TauCeti.neg_one_pow_mul_fwdDiff_iter_eq_alternating_sum`: the binomial expansion of the
  alternating iterated forward difference.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.norm_apply_add_star_le`: a bound at the "norm points" `a + star a`
  bounds a positive-definite function at every point `p + star q`.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.sub_shift`: the difference of a bounded positive-definite function
  and its translate by a self-adjoint element is positive definite.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.neg_one_pow_mul_fwdDiff_iter` and
  `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.alternating_sum`: the alternating iterated differences are positive
  definite, in forward-difference and in binomial form.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.sub_shift_add_star_self_nonneg`,
  `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.neg_one_pow_mul_fwdDiff_iter_add_star_self_nonneg` and
  `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.alternating_sum_add_star_self_nonneg`: the resulting nonnegativity at
  the "norm points" `a + star a`.

Translation by `s` with `star s = s` is a symmetric shift of the kernel `(a, b) ↦ F (a + star b)`,
so the bounded-kernel estimate `TauCeti.posSemidef_sub_comp_shift` applies; only the diagonal of
that kernel, the values at the "norm points" `a + star a`, has to be bounded. Boundedness cannot be
dropped: `t ↦ exp t` is positive definite on `ℝ≥0` with the trivial involution and increases. -/
