# The cluster set of a map on a convex domain

`TauCeti.isPreconnected_clusterSetOn` makes the cluster set of a map connected as soon as the
approach regions `U ∩ t` are connected along a neighbourhood basis of the approach point. On a
**convex** domain that hypothesis is automatic, at every point of the ambient space: the
intersection of `U` with a ball is convex, and balls form a neighbourhood basis. This file records
that specialization, which is how the hypothesis is discharged in practice — the disc, a half-plane
and a polygon are all convex.

Convexity of `U` is used only through the convexity of `U ∩ ball w δ`; the point `w` is arbitrary
and in particular need not lie in `U`, the interesting case being a boundary point. Nothing is
assumed of the map beyond continuity on `U` and values in a compact set: connectedness of the
cluster set is a property of the *domain*, not of the map.

The consumer is the Carathéodory boundary correspondence, layer **L5** of the conformal-mapping
roadmap, where `U` is the unit disc: the cluster set of a Riemann map at a boundary point is a
continuum, and the conformal layer places that continuum *on the frontier of the image*.
Carathéodory's theorem is the assertion that for a Jordan domain it degenerates to a point.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isPreconnected_clusterSetOn_of_convex` and `TauCeti.isConnected_clusterSetOn_of_convex`
  — on a convex domain the cluster set is preconnected, and is a continuum at a point of the
  closure.
* `TauCeti.isConnected_clusterSetOn_of_convex_of_isBounded` — the form used in practice: a
  continuous map with bounded image into a proper metric space.

`TauCeti.isPreconnected_clusterSetOn` is discharged by the balls around `w`, whose intersections
with a convex `U` are convex, hence preconnected. -/
