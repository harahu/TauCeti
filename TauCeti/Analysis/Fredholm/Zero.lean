# The zero Fredholm operator

This file characterizes when the zero continuous linear map is Fredholm. Its kernel is the whole
domain and its cokernel is the whole codomain, so it is Fredholm exactly when both spaces are
finite dimensional. In that case its index is `dim E - dim F`.

The result is the boundary case for finite-dimensional reductions in the Fredholm substrate of the
analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap: after an infinite-dimensional invertible block is split off, a
remaining zero block records precisely the finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.isFredholm_zero_iff`: the zero operator is Fredholm exactly when its domain and
  codomain are finite dimensional.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_zero`: the index of the zero operator is the difference of
  the dimensions of its domain and codomain.

The conventions follow McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix
A.1.
