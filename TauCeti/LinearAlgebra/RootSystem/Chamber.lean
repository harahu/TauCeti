# The dominant chamber of a base

Over a linearly ordered coefficient ring the simple coroots of a base cut the weight space into
sign-pattern cones, the Weyl chambers. This file introduces the dominant one, both closed and
open, and proves that it meets every Weyl orbit: every weight can be moved into the closed
dominant chamber by some element of the Weyl group. Equivalently, the Weyl translates of the
closed dominant chamber cover the whole weight space.

The two chambers are defined by the signs of the *simple* coroot functionals. Since the coroot of
a positive root is a nonnegative integer combination of the simple coroots, the same sign
conditions in fact hold for all of the positive roots at once, and the file ends by recording that
description of both chambers.

The proof is the classical maximization argument. The Weyl group of a finite root system is
finite, so the sum of the coroot functionals indexed by the positive roots, evaluated along an
orbit, attains a maximum. A simple reflection `sᵢ` permutes the positive roots other than `αᵢ`
and sends `αᵢ` to `-αᵢ`, so applying `sᵢ` changes that sum by `-2⟨αᵢ^∨, x⟩`; maximality
therefore forces `⟨αᵢ^∨, x⟩ ≥ 0` for every simple root, which is dominance.

The weights lying on none of the walls are the **regular** ones. Regularity is defined here too,
since it is the condition separating the two chambers: a dominant weight is strictly dominant
exactly when it is regular. It is stated with no order on the coefficient ring, and is manifestly
Weyl-invariant.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsRegularWeight` is regularity of a weight: no coroot functional vanishes on it.
* `TauCeti.dominantChamber` is the closed dominant chamber of a base.
* `TauCeti.openDominantChamber` is its open counterpart.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isRegularWeight_smul`: regularity is invariant under the Weyl group.
* `TauCeti.mem_openDominantChamber_of_isRegularWeight` and
  `TauCeti.isRegularWeight_of_mem_openDominantChamber`: the strictly dominant weights are exactly
  the regular dominant ones.
* `TauCeti.exists_mem_dominantChamber_of_finite_weylGroup` and
  `TauCeti.exists_mem_dominantChamber`: every weight is Weyl-conjugate into the closed dominant
  chamber.
* `TauCeti.iUnion_smul_dominantChamber_eq_univ`: the Weyl translates of the closed dominant
  chamber cover the weight space.
* `TauCeti.ofIdx_smul_notMem_dominantChamber` and
  `TauCeti.ofIdx_smul_ne_of_mem_openDominantChamber`: a simple reflection moves every point of the
  open dominant chamber, and moves it out of the closed chamber.
* `TauCeti.mem_dominantChamber_iff_forall_mem_posRoots` and
  `TauCeti.mem_openDominantChamber_iff_forall_mem_posRoots`: the two chambers are cut out by all of
  the positive coroot functionals, not just the simple ones.

## Implementation notes

The roadmap states this layer over `ℝ`. Nothing in the argument uses completeness, division, or
the archimedean property, so the statements here are made over an arbitrary linearly ordered
commutative ring; `ℝ` and `ℚ` are the intended instances.

The maximization argument is proved as `exists_mem_dominantChamber_of_finite_weylGroup`, which
asks for no root-system assumption: on top of the standing `Finite ι`, `P.IsCrystallographic` and
`P.IsReduced` hypotheses that the positive-root permutation step needs, it assumes only
`Finite P.weylGroup`. The roadmap-signature `exists_mem_dominantChamber` is the root-system case,
where that finiteness comes from `RootPairing.finite_weylGroup`.

Regularity quantifies over *all* root indices, not just the positive ones. The two are equivalent,
since the coroot functional of a negated root is the negative of the original, and quantifying
over everything keeps the predicate manifestly Weyl-invariant, which is what the chamber arguments
downstream use.

The statements that measure a coroot against the base assume `P.flip.IsReduced` alongside
`P.IsReduced`; Mathlib's `RootPairing.instFlipIsReduced` supplies it whenever `N` is torsion free,
which is automatic over a field.

## References

This file implements the chamber definitions of Layer 4 ("Weyl chambers as cones") and the
existence half of its fundamental-domain item (`exists_mem_dominantChamber`) in
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`, following the target signatures in
that roadmap's `Suggested.lean`. Uniqueness of the dominant representative is not proved here.

The argument is the one in J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation
Theory*, GTM 9, Ch. III, §10.3.
