# One-dimensional representations from linear characters

A **linear character** of a monoid `G` over a commutative semiring `k` is a multiplicative
character `χ : G →* kˣ`. It acts on the one-dimensional `k`-module `k` by scalar multiplication.
This file packages that action as `Representation.ofLinearCharacter χ`, bundles it as an object
`FDRep.ofLinearCharacter χ` of `FDRep k G`, and records the facts every consumer of a linear
character needs: its character is `χ`, it is a line, it is simple, it restricts along a
homomorphism by pulling `χ` back, and two of them are isomorphic exactly when the two characters
are equal.

The construction is the common core of the linear characters of the Borel subgroup and of
`GL₂`; keeping it here avoids separate scalar-action implementations for each group. It is also
the smallest nonzero representation there is, and it is what the induction machinery is fed in the
classical worked examples: `Ind_H^G` of a linear character of a subgroup is a *monomial*
representation, and its irreducibility is what the Mackey criterion decides.

## Main definitions

* `Representation.ofLinearCharacter`: the one-dimensional representation associated to a
  unit-valued multiplicative character.
* `FDRep.ofLinearCharacter`: the same representation as an object of `FDRep k G`.

## Main results

* `Representation.ofLinearCharacter_apply`: the action is multiplication by the character value.
* `Representation.ofLinearCharacter_comp`: restriction of the representation is precomposition of
  the character.
* `Representation.ofLinearCharacter_injective`: the representation remembers its character.
* `Representation.ofLinearCharacter_one`: the trivial character carries the trivial
  representation.
* `Representation.char_ofLinearCharacter` and `FDRep.char_ofLinearCharacter`: the trace character
  is the original character, coerced into the coefficient field.
* `Representation.isIrreducible_ofLinearCharacter`: a line has no room for a proper nonzero
  subrepresentation.
* `FDRep.ofLinearCharacter_def`: the bundled representation is the unbundled one, bundled.
* `FDRep.finrank_ofLinearCharacter`: it is a line.
* `FDRep.simple_ofLinearCharacter`: it is a simple object of `FDRep k G`, being a line.
* `FDRep.actionRes_obj_ofLinearCharacter`: restricting along `f : S →* G` gives the
  one-dimensional representation of the pulled-back character `χ ∘ f`.
* `FDRep.nonempty_iso_ofLinearCharacter_iff`: two of these are isomorphic exactly when the two
  linear characters are equal.

## Implementation notes

Neither definition is exposed: consumers go through the lemmas rather than the body.
`FDRep.ofLinearCharacter_def` is the defining equation the dependent API is derived from, and with
Mathlib's `FDRep.of_ρ'` it recovers the action. That the carrier is the line `k` **on the nose** is
recorded once and for all by `FDRep.actionRes_obj_ofLinearCharacter`, an honest equality of objects
rather than an isomorphism; conjugation, restriction and comparison of these objects are then
computed inside `G →* kˣ` through it and `FDRep.nonempty_iso_ofLinearCharacter_iff`.
