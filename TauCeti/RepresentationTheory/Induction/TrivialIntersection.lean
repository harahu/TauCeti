# Induction from a trivial-intersection subgroup

Let `H` be a trivial-intersection subgroup of a finite group `G`: one meeting each of its distinct
conjugates trivially (`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup`).  A class function on `H` that vanishes at the
identity then induces to `G` *without changing its values on `H`*, and therefore without changing
its norm, as long as the relevant group order is invertible in the coefficient field `k` — the
characteristic of `k` must not divide it, as everywhere in this theory, because induction divides
by that order.  Concretely, if `f` is a class function on `H` with `f 1 = 0` then

`Res_H (Ind_H^G f) = f`  when `(|H| : k)` is a unit,  hence  `⟨Ind f, Ind f⟩_G = ⟨f, f⟩_H`  when
`(|G| : k)` is (which gives the former, by `TauCeti.isUnit_natCard_subgroup`).  All the statements
below carry that hypothesis.

The first statement is `TauCeti.ClassFunction.comap_subtype_ind_eq_self` and the second is
`TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_ind`.  This is the isometry that the exceptional-character route to
Frobenius's theorem runs on: it is what makes a difference `χᵢ - χⱼ` of two *distinct* ordinary
irreducible characters of `H` *of the same degree*, which then vanishes at `1` and has norm `2`,
induce to a norm-`2` virtual character of `G`, so that it is `±` a difference of two irreducible
characters of `G`.  (Both qualifications are needed: `(χᵢ - χⱼ) 1 = χᵢ 1 - χⱼ 1` is the difference
of the two degrees, and the norm is `2` by orthonormality only for distinct ordinary characters.)

The hypothesis is not the tautology that `f` vanishes off `H`, which holds for every class function
on `H` and gives no such conclusion.  What is used is the trivial-intersection condition: for
`y ∉ H`, an element of `H` conjugated by `y` back into `H` must be the identity, where `f` vanishes.
So exactly the terms of the group sum coming from outside `H` drop out, and the remaining `|H|`
terms all equal `f x`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.indClassFun_apply_coe`: the induced class function agrees with `f` on `H`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFunction.comap_subtype_ind_eq_self`: restriction undoes induction, `Res ∘ Ind = id`.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_ind`: induction preserves the character pairing.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_ind_of_isTISet` and `TauCeti.isometry_ind_of_isTISet`: the same,
  for a class function supported on a trivial-intersection set of a proper trivial-intersection
  subgroup, which is the form Frobenius's theorem uses (applied there to a Frobenius complement).

## Implementation notes

Only `f₂ 1 = 0` is needed for `TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_ind`, not the same hypothesis on `f₁`:
the proof is Frobenius reciprocity `⟨Ind f₁, Ind f₂⟩ = ⟨f₁, Res (Ind f₂)⟩` followed by
`Res (Ind f₂) = f₂`, and only the second factor is restricted.  Since
`TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing_symm` says the pairing is symmetric, the hypothesis may be
put on either argument.

/-- **A class function vanishing at the identity of a trivial-intersection subgroup induces to a
function agreeing with it on the subgroup.**

In the group-sum form `|H| · (Ind f)(x) = ∑_{y ∈ G} f (y⁻¹ x y)` (terms with `y⁻¹ x y ∉ H` read as
`0`), a term with `y ∉ H` contributes nothing: if `y⁻¹ x y ∈ H` then the trivial-intersection
condition forces `x = 1`, and `f` vanishes there.  The `|H|` terms with `y ∈ H` each equal `f x`,
because `f` is a class function. -/

/-- **Induction from a trivial-intersection set preserves the norm**, the special case of
`TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_ind_of_isTISet` at equal arguments.  A difference of two distinct
ordinary irreducible characters of `H` of the same degree is supported off the identity and has
norm `2`, so it induces to a norm-`2` virtual character of `G`; that is the step the
exceptional-character correspondence begins with.

The name is the one the character-theory roadmap pins for this result: preserving the pairing at
equal arguments is preservation of the norm, which is what "isometry" refers to. -/
