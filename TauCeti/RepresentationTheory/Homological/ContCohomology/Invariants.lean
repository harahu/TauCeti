# Invariants of a discrete module as a module over a quotient

For a normal subgroup `H` of `G` acting distributively on an additive group `M`, the invariants
`M ^ H` carry a distributive action of `G ⧸ H`. Over a profinite `G` with `H` open normal this is
the coefficient system of the finite-level tower computing continuous cohomology: the finite group
`G ⧸ H` acts on the discrete module `M ^ H`, and shrinking `H` enlarges `M ^ H` along transition
inclusions. For a general normal `H` the same quotient action is the coefficient half of
inflation, and it is again continuous as soon as the `G`-action on the discrete module `M` is.

The invariant subgroup `M ^ H` is Mathlib's `FixedPoints.addSubgroup H M`; no second name for it is
introduced here, and its distributive `G`- and `G ⧸ H`-actions are the generic ones supplied by
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/GroupAction/FixedPoints.lean`, together with the generic transition
inclusions and coefficient-map functoriality. What this file adds is the topology: the two
finite-level facts the tower needs — directedness over the open normal subgroups and continuity of
the discrete quotient action — together with the two facts inflation needs, namely continuity of
the `G ⧸ H`-action for an *arbitrary* normal `H` over a continuously acting `G`, and continuity of
the inclusion `M ^ H ↪ M`. It also identifies the explicit fixed-point coefficient object with
the quotient invariants of the corresponding object in the discrete-module dictionary.

The fixed-point functoriality and finite-level facts are first stated for an additive monoid with a
distributive `G`-action, then specialized to `FixedPoints.addSubgroup` for additive groups; an
abelian group gives the usual discrete-module theory. The topology classes are added only where
continuity is used, and no new bundling structure is introduced, so instance search composes the
unbundled classes freely.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.directed_fixedPoints_addSubmonoid` and
  `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPointsAddSubmonoid`, with their additive-subgroup forms
  `TauCeti.directed_fixedPoints_addSubgroup` and `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPoints`:
  the fixed points over the open normal subgroups form a directed family, and each carries a
  continuous action of the discrete quotient group.
* `TauCeti.continuous_fixedPoints_addSubgroup_subtype`: the inclusion `M ^ H ↪ M` is continuous,
  in the `AddSubgroup.subtype` spelling that the compatible pairs of inflation need.
* `TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPointsOfContinuousSMul`: for an *arbitrary* normal subgroup
  `H` of a group with a topology acting continuously on a discrete module, the quotient `G ⧸ H`
  acts continuously on `M ^ H`; no compatibility of the topology of `G` with its group structure
  is used.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModuleQuotient`: the coefficient dictionary identifies the explicit
  fixed-point module with `TopRep.quotientToInvariants`, compatibly with both inclusions into the
  ambient coefficient module.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.fixedPointsInclusion_continuousFiniteQuotientMap_smul`: the inclusion
  `M^U → M^V` for open normal subgroups `V ≤ U` commutes with the actions along the continuous
  quotient map `G ⧸ V → G ⧸ U`.
* `TauCeti.continuous_fixedPointsPairing`: a jointly continuous equivariant pairing remains
  jointly continuous after restriction to invariant coefficients.

For open normal subgroups `V ≤ U`, the inclusion `M ^ U ↪ M ^ V` commutes with the actions
after restriction along `G ⧸ V → G ⧸ U`. Thus the quotient homomorphism and coefficient
inclusion form the compatible pair used by finite-quotient cohomology transition maps.

`TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPoints`, which reads the continuity off the discreteness of

the `G`-action: the invariants are discrete, so continuity is continuity in the group variable
alone, and there it is the continuity of the `G`-action read through the quotient map. No
compatibility of the topology of `G` with its group structure is needed, since `G ⧸ H` carries the
