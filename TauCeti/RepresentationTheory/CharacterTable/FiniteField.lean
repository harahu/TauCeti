# A finite field containing the roots of unity splits the centre of the group algebra

Let `G` be a finite group and `K` a finite field whose characteristic does not divide `|G|` and
whose multiplicative order kills `G`, that is `g ^ |K| = g` for every `g : G` -- equivalently, the
exponent of `G` divides `|K| - 1`, so that `K` already contains the roots of unity that the
eigenvalues of `G` need. This file proves that under exactly those hypotheses the centre of `K[G]`
is *split*: it is `K`-algebra isomorphic to a product of copies of `K`, one for each conjugacy
class of `G`.

The point is that `K` is not algebraically closed, so nothing forces the residue fields of
`Z(K[G])` to be `K` rather than proper extensions of it -- for some coefficient fields they can be
proper extensions, and splitting can fail. What rules that out is the following trace argument,
which is the whole content of the file.

For any `u : K[G]`, the trace of the matrix `M` of left multiplication by `u` in the group basis
is `|G|` times the coefficient of `u` at `1` (`TauCeti.trace_leftMulMatrix_monoidAlgebra`), and
over a finite field
`Matrix.trace (M ^ |K|) = (Matrix.trace M) ^ |K|` (`FiniteField.trace_pow_card`). Since
`a ^ |K| = a` in `K`, the coefficient at `1` is unchanged by raising to the `|K|`-th power, once
`|G|` is invertible. Now apply this to `u = y * g⁻¹` for a *central* `y`: there
`(y * g⁻¹) ^ |K| = y ^ |K| * g⁻¹`, because `y` is central and `g⁻¹ ^ |K| = g⁻¹`, so the identity
compares the coefficients of `y ^ |K|` and of `y` at each `g`. Hence `y ^ |K| = y`.

A commutative ring on which the `|K|`-th power map is the identity is reduced, and a finite domain
on which it is the identity is `K` itself; so the centre, being reduced and Artinian, is the
product of its residue fields, all of which are `K`. Counting `K`-dimensions against the class-sum
basis identifies the number of factors with the number of conjugacy classes.

This is the good-prime structure theorem of the Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm, stated for a
general finite coefficient field; the specialization to `ZMod p` at a good Dixon prime is
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Dixon/Structure.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.pow_card_eq_self_of_mem_center`: the centre of `K[G]` is fixed by `x ↦ x ^ |K|`.
* `TauCeti.algebraMap_center_quotient_bijective`: every residue field of the centre is `K`.
* `TauCeti.centerAlgEquivPi`: the centre is the algebra of functions on its own maximal spectrum.
* `TauCeti.card_maximalSpectrum_center`: that spectrum has one point per conjugacy class.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_center_algEquiv_conjClasses`: `Z(K[G]) ≃ₐ[K] (ConjClasses G → K)`.

`K` whose characteristic does not divide `|G|`, the identity coefficient of `u ^ |K|` is that of
`u`, for *every* `u` in the group algebra.

This is the trace identity `tr (M ^ |K|) = (tr M) ^ |K|` for the left regular matrix `M` of `u`,

/-- **The centre of the group algebra is fixed by the Frobenius of `K`.** Let `K` be a finite field
whose characteristic does not divide `|G|` and whose multiplicative order kills `G`, that is
`g ^ |K| = g` for every `g` (equivalently, the exponent of `G` divides `|K| - 1`). Then every
central element `y` of `K[G]` satisfies `y ^ |K| = y`.

The proof tests `y` against the group elements: `(y * g⁻¹) ^ |K| = y ^ |K| * g⁻¹` because `y` is
central and `g⁻¹` is fixed by the `|K|`-th power map, so `TauCeti.coeff_one_pow_card` applied to
`y * g⁻¹` compares the coefficients of `y ^ |K|` and `y` at `g`. -/
