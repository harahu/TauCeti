# Summing the coefficients of a multivariate power series along a ray

Fix an exponent `d` and read the coefficients of `u` along the rays `ν, ν + d, ν + 2d, …`. Two
convergence statements need only a nonarchimedean coefficient group: if the coefficients of `u`
tend to zero along the cofinite filter, then so do the ray sums, and so do the coefficients along
each single ray once the step `d` is nonzero.

The coefficient ring is a (not necessarily commutative) `Ring`: `MvPowerSeries.coeff` is an
`R`-linear map, so `Semiring R` is the floor for stating any of this, and the nonarchimedean and
uniform hypotheses below need the additive group.

Peeling the first term of a ray is a statement about an actual sum, so it asks for more: the
coefficient group must also be complete and separated for a compatible uniform structure
(`[UniformSpace R] [IsUniformAddGroup R] [CompleteSpace R] [T0Space R]`), which is what makes each
ray summable and its `tsum` the value one expects.

The rays are what turns a statement about a *diagonal* — the exponents congruent to one another
modulo `d` — into one about coefficients, which is how the decomposition of a two-variable
restricted series modulo `1 - XY` is proved.

## Main results

* `MvPowerSeries.tendsto_tsum_coeff_add_nsmul`: the ray sums tend to zero along `cofinite`.
* `MvPowerSeries.tendsto_coeff_add_nsmul`: along one ray the coefficients tend to zero, provided
  the step `d` is nonzero.
* `MvPowerSeries.tsum_coeff_add_nsmul_eq`: peeling the first term of a ray, over a complete
  separated nonarchimedean uniform additive group.

/-- **The ray sums tend to zero**: if the coefficients of `u` tend to zero along `cofinite`, so
does `ν ↦ ∑' n, coeff (ν + n • d) u`. A nonarchimedean subgroup `W` is closed, so a ray sum
outside `W` must have a term outside `W`, and `ν` lies below that term's index. -/
