# Computable cyclotomic integers

This file defines `TauCeti.Cyclotomic e`, an exact, computable model of
`ℤ[X] / (Polynomial.cyclotomic e ℤ)`.  Its elements are the `e.totient` coefficients of the
canonical representative, in descending order; `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.coeff` reads off the coordinate
of a single power of `ζ`.  Addition, negation, multiplication, and equality are genuine
computations on finite lists of integers; multiplication convolves coefficient lists with
`TauCeti.Polynomial.mulCoeffList` and then applies the computable cyclotomic reduction from
`TauCeti.RingTheory.Polynomial.Cyclotomic.Computable`.

The ring is identified with Mathlib's `AdjoinRoot (Polynomial.cyclotomic e ℤ)`.  For nonzero `e`,
evaluation at `exp (2 * π * I / e)` then gives the distinguished embedding into `ℂ` used to state
the correctness of exact character-table computations.

The interface followed here is the one blueprinted in the character-theory roadmap
(`RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap, Layer 6: "Exact cyclotomic
arithmetic", whose `Suggested.lean` pins `Cyclotomic e` with its `CommRing` instance, the
generator `ζ_e` as the class of `X`, the reduction to `ZMod p`, and the *pinned* embedding into
`ℂ` as a ring homomorphism together with its injectivity).  The choice of `exp (2 * π * I / e)`
for that pin, of descending coefficient lists as the representation, and the identification with
`AdjoinRoot` rather than the roadmap's `CyclotomicRing e ℤ ℚ` are this file's.
