# Completeness of the weighted restricted power series over a complete base

Over a nonarchimedean ring `A` whose weights `Tν = T₁^ν₁ ⋯ Tₖ^νₖ` are bounded
(`TauCeti.Huber.IsBounded`), the weighted restricted power-series ring
`TauCeti.Huber.weightedRestrictedSubring` is Hausdorff whenever `A` is, and complete over a
complete uniform `A`. Boundedness is the whole of what the arguments need beyond Wedhorn's
standing hypothesis: the neighbourhood subgroup `U⟨X⟩` maps into `Tν · U` coefficientwise, and
boundedness of `Tν` says exactly that `Tν · U` still shrinks to zero with `U`, so the
coefficient maps are continuous — and uniformly continuous once `A` carries a uniformity.
Points are then separated coefficientwise, and a Cauchy filter of restricted series is
coefficientwise Cauchy, its coefficientwise limit is again restricted, and the filter converges
to it. Both facts are Wedhorn's Proposition 5.49 (*Adic Spaces*, arXiv:1910.05934v1) —
Hausdorffness is its part (2), and completeness is the step its part (3) is proved by, the one
that then identifies `A⟨X⟩_T` with the completion of `A[X]_T`. Its part (1), density of the
polynomials, is `TauCeti.Huber.dense_weightedPolynomials` in the parent module.

The trivial weight family `Tᵢ = {1}` is bounded, since `Tν` is then the singleton `{1}`, so the
ordinary restricted power-series ring `A⟨X⟩` gets each of the four facts by specialisation. It
is that case the comparison below runs on, and the two `T0Space`/`CompleteSpace` statements are
registered as instances there.

Hausdorffness is purely topological — it uses only continuity of the coefficient maps — so it
is proved in a section over a nonarchimedean ring with no uniformity of its own, which is the
setting the rest of the Huber development works in; the uniform hypotheses on `A` enter only
with completeness.

Consequently `TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletion k A` collapses:
`TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionEquiv` identifies `A⟨X₁,…,Xₖ⟩` with the
plain restricted-series ring — the "comparison with the usual completed restricted
power-series algebra" milestone of roadmap Layer 0.5. Its hypotheses are completeness and
Hausdorffness of that ring itself rather than of `A`, which the instances here supply over a
complete Hausdorff base and which hold over a discrete base too, so that the comparison also
covers `TauCeti.Huber.IsStronglyNoetherian.of_discreteTopology`. It is packaged twice over
one and the same underlying map — as that ring isomorphism and as the `A`-algebra equivalence
`TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionAlgEquiv`, the two tied together by
`TauCeti.Huber.coe_restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionAlgEquiv` and
`TauCeti.Huber.coe_restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionAlgEquiv_symm` — and both it and its
inverse are uniformly continuous, hence continuous by `UniformContinuous.continuous`. Nothing
in that block is special to restricted series: every declaration in it specializes a generic
statement about `UniformSpace.Completion.completeRingEquivSelf` proved in
`TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.UniformRing`.

Three steps are named as `private` lemmas rather than exported as API. That the subring's
uniformity is the one its subgroup basis induces is definitional, and is named so that the
argument does not silently depend on the two being reducibly equal; it specializes Mathlib's
`AddGroupFilterBasis.cauchy_iff`, with a single use here. The passage of a Cauchy filter to its
coefficientwise limits — where `Tν · U` has to be closed, by
`TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.isOpen_weightMul` and `AddSubgroup.isClosed_of_isOpen` — is used
twice in the completeness proof. Boundedness of the trivial weight, read off
`TauCeti.Huber.weightPow_one_weight` and `TauCeti.Huber.isBounded_singleton`, is what all four
specialisations are discharged with.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.continuous_coeff` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.IsWeightFamily.uniformContinuous_coeff` : the `ν`-th coefficient map of
  `A⟨X⟩_T` is continuous, and uniformly continuous over a uniform base, as soon as the single
  weight `Tν` is bounded.
* `TauCeti.Huber.t0Space_weightedRestrictedSubring` : Wedhorn 5.49(2) — with every weight
  bounded, `A⟨X⟩_T` over a Hausdorff base is Hausdorff.
* `TauCeti.Huber.completeSpace_weightedRestrictedSubring` : Wedhorn 5.49(3) — with every weight
  bounded, `A⟨X⟩_T` over a complete base is complete.
* `TauCeti.Huber.continuous_coeff_one_weight`,
  `TauCeti.Huber.t0Space_weightedRestrictedSubring_one_weight`,
  `TauCeti.Huber.uniformContinuous_coeff_one_weight` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.completeSpace_weightedRestrictedSubring_one_weight` : those four at the
  trivial weight family. The `T0Space` and `CompleteSpace` ones are the registered instances;
  the two coefficient-map results are theorems. This is the case the comparison needs.
* `TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionEquiv` : the comparison — `A⟨X₁,…,Xₖ⟩` is
  the plain restricted-series ring, whenever that ring is complete and Hausdorff.
* `TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionAlgEquiv` : the same comparison as an
  `A`-algebra equivalence.
* `TauCeti.Huber.uniformContinuous_restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionEquiv` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.uniformContinuous_restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionEquiv_symm` : the
  comparison and its inverse are uniformly continuous. The inverse is the canonical map into
  the completion, which is `TauCeti.Huber.coe_restrictedMvPowerSeriesCompletionEquiv_symm`.

## Provenance

AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) is the roadmap's designated prior
formalisation for this row. At commit `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08` its file
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/RestrictedPowerSeries.lean` states nothing about
completeness, Hausdorffness, or the completion of the restricted-series ring, so there was
nothing to port here; nothing was copied.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic], Proposition 5.49(2) and (3), for a bounded weight
  family — of which the trivial family `Tᵢ = {1}` is the case used below.

The hypotheses are completeness and Hausdorffness of the restricted-series ring itself, not
of `A`: the instances above supply them over a complete Hausdorff base, and over a discrete
base they hold because the ring is then discrete. Each declaration specializes a generic
statement about `UniformSpace.Completion.completeRingEquivSelf`. -/
