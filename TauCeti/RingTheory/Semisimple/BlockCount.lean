# Block counts and factor matching for products of simple rings

Artin--Wedderburn presents a semisimple ring `R` as a finite product of matrix algebras over
division rings,

`R ≃+* ∏ᵢ Matₙᵢ(Dᵢ)`,

and Mathlib supplies such a presentation but says nothing about how much of it is determined by
`R`.  This file proves the first uniqueness statement: **the number of blocks is the same for any
two presentations** (`TauCeti.card_blocks_eq`).

The invariant that sees the block count is the set of central idempotents.  A ring isomorphism
carries central idempotents to central idempotents, they are computed coordinatewise on a product,
and a simple ring has exactly two of them; so a product of `m` simple rings has exactly `2 ^ m`
central idempotents, and `m` is recovered from `R`.  Those three ingredients are supplied by
`TauCeti/RingTheory/CentralIdempotent.lean`; this file combines them, first in the natural
generality of products of arbitrary simple rings and then for products of matrix algebras over
simple rings, such as Wedderburn presentations, whose blocks are simple by `IsSimpleRing.matrix`.
It also strengthens the count for an isomorphism between two products: the coordinate central
idempotents determine a permutation of the factors, and the original isomorphism restricts to an
isomorphism on every matched pair.

Positivity of the block sizes is essential and not decoration: `Matₒ(D)` is the trivial ring, which
is not simple, and a presentation could be padded with any number of such blocks without changing
`R`.  This is the same `NeZero` hypothesis that
`IsSemisimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_divisionRing` produces.  Semisimplicity of `R` is *not*
needed anywhere: the count is an invariant of any ring admitting such a presentation, and
semisimplicity is what guarantees a presentation exists in the first place.

The finer uniqueness — that the degrees `nᵢ` and division rings `Dᵢ` match after a permutation — is
`TauCeti.wedderburn_blocks_unique` in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Semisimple/Wedderburn/Uniqueness.lean`.  It upgrades the counting argument here:
the coordinate central idempotents themselves determine the factor permutation, after which
`TauCeti.wedderburn_data_unique` identifies each corresponding pair of matrix blocks.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.card_eq_of_ringEquiv_pi_of_isSimpleRing`: two presentations of a ring as a finite
  product of simple rings have the same number of factors.
* `TauCeti.exists_equiv_factors_of_ringEquiv_pi`: an isomorphism between finite products of simple
  rings induces a permutation and compatible isomorphisms of the matched factors.
* `TauCeti.card_blocks_eq`: **the number of blocks of a presentation as a product of matrix
  algebras over simple rings, such as a Wedderburn presentation, is an invariant of the ring.**

/-- **A ring isomorphism between finite products of simple rings permutes their factors.**

The returned factor isomorphisms are restrictions of the original isomorphism: mapping an element
supported at `i` gives the corresponding element supported at `σ i`.  The permutation need not be
canonical when some factors are isomorphic. -/

/-- **Invariance of the block count.** Two presentations of the same ring as products of matrix
algebras over simple rings, such as two Wedderburn presentations, have the same number of blocks.

The `NeZero` hypotheses on the block sizes are essential, exactly as in Mathlib's
`IsSemisimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_divisionRing`: a block of size `0` is the trivial
ring, so without them any presentation could be padded with empty blocks and the count would not be
an invariant.  Semisimplicity of `R` is not needed — it is what makes a presentation exist, not
what makes the count well defined. -/
