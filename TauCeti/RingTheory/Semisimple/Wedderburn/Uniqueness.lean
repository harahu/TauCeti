# Uniqueness of Wedderburn blocks

Artin--Wedderburn presents a semisimple ring as a finite product of matrix rings over division
rings.  `TauCeti.card_blocks_eq` proves that two such presentations have equally many blocks, and
`TauCeti.wedderburn_data_unique` proves that the size and coefficient division ring of a *single*
matrix block are intrinsic.  The generic factor matching in
`TauCeti.exists_equiv_factors_of_ringEquiv_pi` permutes the factors of the two products; this file
applies the single-block result to each matched pair and concludes that two Wedderburn
presentations have the same matrix sizes and division rings after one permutation of the blocks.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.wedderburn_blocks_unique`: two Wedderburn presentations have matching degrees and
  coefficient division rings after a permutation of their blocks.

/-- **Uniqueness of every block in a Wedderburn presentation.** Two presentations of a ring as a
finite product of positive-size matrix rings over division rings differ only by a permutation of
the blocks: corresponding matrix sizes agree and their coefficient division rings are isomorphic.

The positivity hypotheses are essential.  A zero-size matrix ring is trivial and can be inserted
with arbitrary coefficients without changing the product. -/
