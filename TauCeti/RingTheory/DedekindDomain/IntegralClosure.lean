# The integral closure of a Dedekind domain is Dedekind, with no separability

Let `A` be a Dedekind domain with fraction field `K`, let `L` be a finite extension of `K`, and let
`C` be an integral closure of `A` in `L`. Then `C` is again a Dedekind domain. **No separability of
`L / K` is assumed**, so inseparable extensions are covered, and with them the Frobenius isogeny of
a curve over a field of positive characteristic.

Mathlib proves the same statement as `IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain`, but under
`[Algebra.IsSeparable K L]`. Only one of the three conditions defining a Dedekind domain is
responsible for that hypothesis: Mathlib reaches Noetherianity through the trace pairing, which is
nondegenerate exactly in the separable case. Integral closedness and dimension at most one are
already separability-free there. So the whole of the work is to replace that one input by
Krull–Akizuki, `TauCeti.IsIntegralClosure.isNoetherianRing`; the other two components are Mathlib's,
unchanged.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain`: an integral closure of a Noetherian domain of
  dimension at most one, such as a Dedekind domain, in a finite extension of its fraction field is
  a Dedekind domain, with no separability hypothesis.
* `TauCeti.integralClosure.isDedekindDomain`: the same for Mathlib's `integralClosure A L`, with
  the fraction field chosen by the caller.
* `TauCeti.integralClosure.isDedekindDomain_fractionRing`: the instance form, with
  `K := FractionRing A`.

## Design

**What the trace pairing takes with it.** Mathlib's separable route produces `Module.Finite A C`
along the way (`IsIntegralClosure.finite`), and that by-product genuinely does not survive:
Krull–Akizuki bounds lengths, not ranks, and the integral closure it handles need not be a finite
`A`-module. Only the Dedekind conclusion is recovered here. A caller who also needs finiteness
still needs a normalization-finiteness theorem of Nagata type, which this repository does not have;
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Isogeny/IntermediateRing/Finite.lean` records the same gap
on the isogeny side.

**Why `C` is abstract, and why it need not be a domain.** The main statement is about any `C` with
`[IsIntegralClosure C A L]` rather than about Mathlib's `integralClosure A L` subalgebra, following
the convention of the Krull–Akizuki theorem it consumes. The consumer that motivates it,
`TauCeti.Isogeny.isDedekindDomain_intermediateRing`, holds a `Subring` of a function field which is
known to be an integral closure but is not that subalgebra. The subalgebra case is then supplied
as `integralClosure.isDedekindDomain` and, with `K := FractionRing A`, as the instance
`integralClosure.isDedekindDomain_fractionRing`, mirroring the pair Mathlib provides under
separability. `C` is not assumed to be a domain: `C → L` is injective, so `IsDomain C` is derived
inside the proof, as the Krull–Akizuki theorem does.

## Provenance

⚠ *mathlib-track*. Roadmap: EllipticCurves, the Layers 0-1 target *Function-field foundations and
isogenies* (`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md:1086`), which names
`RingTheory/IntegralClosure/NormalizationFinite` among the supports of D. Angdinata's isogeny
development (`:1096`) and records that the hypothesis inventory of that development is "genuinely
minimal" (`:1097`). Separability is not in that inventory, and this file is what takes it out of
the Dedekind conclusion.

The proof is Mathlib's `IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain`
(`Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/IntegralClosure.lean`) with its Noetherian input replaced: the
dimension component `Ring.DimensionLEOne.of_isIntegral` and the integral-closedness component are
taken from there unchanged, since neither ever used separability. What is not Mathlib's is
`TauCeti.IsIntegralClosure.isNoetherianRing`, proved in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/IntegralClosure/NormalizationFinite.lean`.

namespace TauCeti

/-- **The integral closure of a Noetherian domain of dimension at most one, such as a Dedekind
domain, is a Dedekind domain**, for a finite extension `L` of the fraction field `K` that is not
assumed separable.

This is Mathlib's `IsIntegralClosure.isDedekindDomain` with the separability hypothesis removed, `A`
not assumed integrally closed, and the same explicit arguments `A K L C` in the same order, so a
call site can switch to it by name alone. Separability serves only to make the trace pairing
nondegenerate and so deliver Noetherianity, and Krull–Akizuki
(`TauCeti.IsIntegralClosure.isNoetherianRing`) delivers that without it. Finiteness of `C` as an
`A`-module, which the separable route yields as a by-product, is *not* available here.

`C` need not be given as a domain: it embeds in the field `L`. -/
