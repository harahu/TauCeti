# Localising an open subring at a topologically nilpotent element

Let `B` be an **open** subring of a topological ring `A`, and let `s : B` be topologically
nilpotent in `A`. Inverting `s` on both sides does not distinguish the two rings: the induced map
`B_s → A_s` is a ring isomorphism.

The point is that `B` is open, so a topologically nilpotent `s` absorbs every element of `A` into
`B` after enough multiplications. Passing to `B_s` makes that absorption invertible, which is
exactly what surjectivity needs. Injectivity is not topological at all and is Mathlib's already.

## Implementation notes

Surjectivity goes through the Mathlib criterion rather than through elements of the localisations:
`IsLocalization.Away.map_surjective_iff` reduces it to "every `a : A` is `sᵐ` times the image of
something in `B`", which is `exists_mul_pow_mem_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent` verbatim, up to
commuting the product.

Only `ContinuousMul` is assumed, matching the absorption lemma: continuity of addition, a
nonarchimedean neighbourhood basis and any Huber structure are all irrelevant here.

Injectivity is not proved here at all: it is Mathlib's `IsLocalization.map_injective_of_injective`
applied to `Subring.subtype_injective`, which already says an injective ring map induces an
injective map on the corresponding localisations. Nothing about the subring being *open*, or about
`s`, enters that half.

## Source

Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), the localisation step inside the proof of Lemma
7.44(1). Only that step is formalised here — the spectral half of 7.44(1), the homeomorphism
between the complements of the two closed subsets, is **not** proved in this file.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Localization.awayMap_subtype_surjective_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`: the induced map on
  localisations is surjective when the subring is open and `s` is topologically nilpotent.
* `TauCeti.Localization.awayRingEquivOfIsTopologicallyNilpotent`: the resulting isomorphism
  `B_s ≃+* A_s`.
