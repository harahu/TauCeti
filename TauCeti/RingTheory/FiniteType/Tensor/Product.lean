# Reduced tensor products over an algebraically closed field

A reduced finite-type algebra over an algebraically closed field stays reduced after tensoring
with any reduced algebra. This applies in particular to the tensor square of a coordinate ring
modulo its nilradical, before any Hopf structure has been constructed on that quotient.
