# Complex conjugation on a CM field is place-independent

`TauCeti/NumberTheory/NumberField/ComplexConjugation/Basic.lean` attaches a conjugation
`complexConjugationAt K w hw` to a complex place `w` of `L` lying above a real place of `K`. The
place is genuinely part of the input: in a general Galois extension the elements attached to
different ramified places are conjugate (`complexConjugationAt_smul`), and conjugate elements
can differ.

A CM field is a case where that dependence disappears. If `K` is CM, with maximal real
subfield `K⁺`, then `K / K⁺` is a totally complex quadratic extension, so

* every infinite place of `K` is ramified over `K⁺` — the hypothesis `hw` is automatic
  (`isRamified_maximalRealSubfield`), and
* the conjugation attached to any place is Mathlib's `IsCMField.complexConj`
  (`complexConj_eq_complexConjugationAt`),

hence any two places give the same element
(`complexConjugationAt_eq_complexConjugationAt`). This is what lets a CM field carry a
place-free complex conjugation, and Mathlib's `IsCMField.complexConj` is the element it names:
on a CM field the place index may simply be dropped, and any statement about
`complexConjugationAt` there transfers to `complexConj`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.isRamified_maximalRealSubfield`: on a CM field every infinite place is
  ramified over the maximal real subfield.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.complexConj_eq_complexConjugationAt`: the conjugation at any place is
  `IsCMField.complexConj`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.complexConjugationAt_eq_complexConjugationAt`: consequently it does not
  depend on the place.
