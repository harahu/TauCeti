# Conjugating `Γ₀(N)` and `Γ₁(N)` by the Fricke matrix

Over a field in which `N` is invertible, and for `σ = !![a, b; c, d] ∈ Γ₀(N)`, so `N ∣ c`,
conjugating by the Fricke matrix `W = !![0, -1; N, 0]` of
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/ModularForms/Fricke/Matrix.lean` gives

`W · σ · W⁻¹ = !![d, -c/N; -N·b, a]`,

which is again integral, again of determinant one, and again in `Γ₀(N)`. This file builds the
right-hand side as an honest `SL(2, ℤ)` matrix — `frickeConjSL` — reading it off the entries of
`σ`, so that it is defined at every level; records that a `Γ₀(N)` input stays inside `Γ₀(N)`
and that a `Γ₁(N)` input stays inside `Γ₁(N)`, again at every level; and proves, over a field
in which `N` is invertible, the two matrix identities that move `W` past `σ` and are what make
`frickeConjSL σ` the conjugate `W · σ · W⁻¹`.

`frickeConjSL` is defined directly by its entries rather than as a product `W * σ * W⁻¹`: the
latter lives in `GL (Fin 2) K` and is only *incidentally* integral, so reading an `SL(2, ℤ)`
element back out of it would need the divisibility argument anyway. Defining it by entries and
proving the product identities afterwards keeps the divisibility in one place.

## Level

`(N : K) ≠ 0` is what makes `W` invertible, and so what makes conjugation by `W` mean
anything. Over the arbitrary field `K` of the identities below that is strictly stronger than
`N ≠ 0`: a nonzero level casts to zero whenever the characteristic of `K` divides it. It is
needed for the *conjugation*, not for the entry formula that computes it, so it is stated where
`W` itself appears: as `[NeZero (N : K)]` on the two normalization identities over `K`, which are
the statements that exhibit `frickeConjSL σ` as a conjugate.

The formula itself needs no level hypothesis: `!![d, -c'; -N·b, a]` has determinant `1`, lies in
`Γ₀(N)` for every `N`, lies in `Γ₁(N)` whenever `σ` does, and is multiplicative in `σ`,
`c = N · (c / N)` holding at `N = 0` as well, both sides being zero. At `N = 0` the value is junk
rather than a conjugation: `Γ₀(0)` is the upper-triangular subgroup, the quotient `c / N` is `0`,
the formula collapses to `!![a, b; 0, d] ↦ !![d, 0; 0, a]`, which forgets `b`, and `frickeGL K 0`
does not exist for it to be a conjugation by.

The names follow the intended meaning rather than that degenerate value, as mathlib's do for
`Matrix.inv` at a singular matrix, for `Int.ediv` by `0`, and for `Gamma0 0` itself:
`frickeConjSL`, `frickeConjGamma0` and `frickeConjGamma1` are named for the Fricke conjugation
they compute. The level hypothesis then appears only on the declarations that need it —
`[NeZero N]` on the two `MulEquiv`s and the involution lemmas, `[NeZero (N : K)]` on the
identities over `K` — and not on the all-level declarations, where `unusedArguments` would reject
it as an argument the definition never uses.

`[NeZero N]` is a hypothesis on the natural number `N`, not on its image in a field: what fails
at level zero is the integer division `c / N`. The entry map is a homomorphism at every level
but an isomorphism only at nonzero level, so `[NeZero N]` is what the two involution lemmas and
the two automorphisms take.

## Base field

The conjugation identities are stated over an arbitrary field `K` in which `N` is invertible,
matching the parameterization of `frickeGL`. The weight-`k` slash action needs them over `ℝ`
while the `GL (Fin 2) ℚ` Hecke-ring stack needs them over `ℚ`; stating them over `K` serves both
directly, with no transport lemma between the two, since `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.mapGL` is
itself defined at an arbitrary algebra.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.frickeConjSL`: the matrix `!![d, -c/N; -N·b, a]` as an element of `SL(2, ℤ)`, read
  off the entries of `σ` at every level; over a field in which `N` is invertible it is the
  conjugate `W · σ · W⁻¹`.
* `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma0`, `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma1`: that map bundled as a group
  endomorphism `Γ₀(N) →* Γ₀(N)`, and its restriction `Γ₁(N) →* Γ₁(N)`. Like the map itself these
  exist at every level, so what they record is that the entry formula preserves the subgroup —
  not, on its own, that `W` normalizes it.
* `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma0MulEquiv`, `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma1MulEquiv`: for `[NeZero N]`, the
  same maps as automorphisms `Γ₀(N) ≃* Γ₀(N)` and `Γ₁(N) ≃* Γ₁(N)`, each its own inverse. These
  are the declarations that say `W` *normalizes* the subgroup.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.coe_frickeConjSL`: the entries of `frickeConjSL σ`, namely `!![d, -c/N; -N·b, a]`.
* `TauCeti.frickeConjSL_mem_Gamma0`: a `Γ₀(N)` input has `frickeConjSL σ ∈ Γ₀(N)`, at every
  level.
* `TauCeti.frickeConjSL_mem_Gamma1`: a `Γ₁(N)` input has `frickeConjSL σ ∈ Γ₁(N)`, at every
  level. This is a second hypothesis on `σ`, not a consequence of the previous line.
* `TauCeti.frickeConjSL_mul`, `TauCeti.frickeConjSL_one`: the entry map is multiplicative and
  unital, at every level. These are what the bundled endomorphisms above are built from.
* `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma0_frickeConjGamma0`, `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma1_frickeConjGamma1`:
  for `[NeZero N]`, applying the entry map twice is the identity.
* `TauCeti.gamma0Map_frickeConjGamma0_mul`: the `Gamma0Map` images of `frickeConjGamma0 σ` and
  of `σ` are inverse in `ZMod N`, at every level. This is the `ZMod`-level content of AINTLIB's
  diamond-character companion; see the Provenance section.
* `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma0MulEquiv_apply`, `TauCeti.frickeConjGamma0MulEquiv_symm`, and their
  `Γ₁` twins: the automorphisms act as the endomorphisms and are their own inverses. These, with
  `coe_frickeConjGamma0` and `coe_frickeConjGamma1`, are the intended interface for the bundled
  declarations: a consumer works through these simp lemmas rather than through the bodies.
* `TauCeti.frickeGL_mul_mapGL`, `TauCeti.mapGL_mul_frickeGL`: for `(N : K) ≠ 0`, the two
  normalization identities `W · σ = (W σ W⁻¹) · W` and `σ · W = W · (W σ W⁻¹)` in
  `GL (Fin 2) K`. These are the statements that exhibit `frickeConjSL σ` as the conjugate
  `W σ W⁻¹`; that `W` normalizes the subgroup is the two `MulEquiv`s.

## Relation to the Atkin–Lehner anti-involution

`TauCeti/NumberTheory/HeckeRing/GL2/Gamma0/AtkinLehner.lean` also carries `Γ₀(N)` into itself,
so the two results look superficially alike. They are different maps. That one is
`g ↦ w · gᵀ · w⁻¹` for the diagonal `w = natDiagGL 2 ![1, N]`: it transposes, and it is an
*anti*-homomorphism, bundled as `HeckeRing.GL2.atkinLehnerAntiInvolution_bar` on the Hecke ring
`Δ₀(N)`. `frickeConjSL` is the entry formula for plain conjugation by `!![0, -1; N, 0]`, with
no transpose, and lives on `Γ₀(N)` itself. The two *matrices* are already distinguished in
`Fricke/Matrix.lean`; this is the corresponding note for the two conjugation maps.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GL2/Fricke.lean`](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB),
commit `340875adfb2`, Apache-2.0, Chris Birkbeck), realizing part of Layer 6 of the ModularForms
roadmap.

Ported from there: the divisibility witness and its spec (`botLeftDiv`, `botLeftDiv_spec`
upstream, `natCast_mul_lowerLeft_ediv` here), `frickeConjSL` with its coercion lemma,
`frickeConjSL_mem_Gamma0` and `frickeConjSL_mem_Gamma1`, and the two normalization identities
`frickeGL_mul_mapGL` and `mapGL_mul_frickeGL`. Added here, with no counterpart upstream:
`frickeConjSL_one`, `frickeConjSL_mul`, `lowerLeft_ediv_mul`, `mapGL_frickeConjSL`, the bundled
`frickeConjGamma0` and `frickeConjGamma1` with their involution lemmas, and the two `MulEquiv`s
`frickeConjGamma0MulEquiv` and `frickeConjGamma1MulEquiv` with their `apply`/`symm` lemmas.

AINTLIB names the divisibility witness `botLeftDiv` and keeps it private. Here its spec is
**public**, as `natCast_mul_lowerLeft_ediv`, and it is `@[simp]`: `coe_frickeConjSL` writes the
quotient `c / N` out as an `Int.ediv`, so a consumer of that `simp` lemma needs the spec to make
progress, and keeping it private would force every use site to re-derive `(N : ℤ) ∣ c` from
`Gamma0_mem`. The public API is therefore the matrix formula together with that one normalization
rule.

AINTLIB obtains the witness as the `Exists.choose` of the `Γ₀(N)` divisibility, which makes it and
`frickeConjSL` `noncomputable` and their entries opaque; here it
is the honest quotient `c / N`, exact because `N ∣ c`, so both definitions are computable and
reduce entrywise. AINTLIB states the two normalization identities over `ℚ` and then transports
each along `ℚ → ℝ` by hand, in `glMap_frickeGL_mul_mapGL` and `mapGL_mul_glMap_frickeGL`; stating
them over `K` as below makes both transports the corresponding instance, so those two lemmas have
no counterpart here.

The diamond-character companion `Gamma0MapUnits_frickeConjSL` is ported in both of its halves.
Its `ZMod`-level content is `gamma0Map_frickeConjGamma0_mul` below, and its unit-valued content is
`toHomUnits_gamma0Map_frickeConjGamma0_eq_inv`. The two differ from upstream in how they reach the
units: AINTLIB states the refinement in terms of its own `Gamma0MapUnits`, a unit-valued refinement
of mathlib's `CongruenceSubgroup.Gamma0Map`, whereas here the same content is obtained from the
`ZMod` identity through mathlib's `MonoidHom.toHomUnits`. What is *not* ported is that
`Gamma0MapUnits` definition itself: TauCeti does not have it, and it belongs with the `Gamma0Map`
API rather than with the Fricke conjugation.
