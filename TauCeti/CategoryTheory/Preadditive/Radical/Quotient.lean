# The space of irreducible morphisms of a linear category

Between two objects `X` and `Y` of a `k`-linear category with binary biproducts and local
endomorphism rings, the morphisms lying in the radical but not in its square are exactly the
irreducible ones
(`TauCeti.isIrreducibleMorphism_iff_mem_jacobsonRadical_and_notMem_jacobsonRadicalSq`).  Under
those hypotheses the quotient `rad(X, Y) / rad²(X, Y)` is therefore the `k`-module whose nonzero
classes are the irreducible morphisms `X ⟶ Y`, and it is the space the arrows `X → Y` of the
Auslander-Reiten quiver are read off from.  This file builds that quotient,
`TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpace k X Y`, on top of the two submodules supplied by
`TauCeti.CategoryTheory.Preadditive.Radical.Basic`.

The three things the Auslander-Reiten quiver needs of it are here.  First, the **detection**
statement: a class is nonzero exactly when the morphism representing it is irreducible, so the
space is nontrivial exactly when an irreducible morphism `X ⟶ Y` exists — that is what makes "there
is an arrow `X → Y`" mean "there is an irreducible morphism `X ⟶ Y`".  Second, **isomorphism
invariance**: conjugating by isomorphisms `X ≅ X'` and `Y ≅ Y'` induces a `k`-linear equivalence
`Irr(X, Y) ≃ₗ[k] Irr(X', Y')`, functorially, which is what lets the arrows be indexed by
*isomorphism classes* of indecomposables.  Third, **finite-dimensionality** over a division ring
whenever the ambient morphism space is finite-dimensional, which is what makes the quiver locally
finite.

The detection statement is the only one that constrains the objects: it needs the two endomorphism
rings to be local (the indecomposables of a Krull-Schmidt category) and the category to have binary
biproducts, exactly as its input in `Radical.Basic` does.  The construction of the quotient and its
linear structure need none of that, so they are stated for an arbitrary `k`-linear category over a
ring `k`.

What is *not* built here is the bimodule structure of `Irr(X, Y)` over the residue division rings
`End X / rad(End X)` and `End Y / rad(End Y)`.  It is the dimensions over *those* rings, not the
`k`-dimension computed below, that count the arrows `X → Y` of the Auslander-Reiten quiver; the two
counts do agree whenever both residue division rings are `k` itself, as happens for instance over an
algebraically closed `k` when the two endomorphism algebras are finite-dimensional over it, but that
is only a sufficient condition — they also agree, vacuously, whenever `Irr(X, Y)` vanishes.  So no
statement below claims to compute an arrow multiplicity: what is proved is the `k`-dimension, its
bound by `finrank k (X ⟶ Y)`, and its positivity exactly when an irreducible morphism exists.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpace k X Y`: the space `rad(X, Y) / rad²(X, Y)` of irreducible
  morphisms, a `k`-module.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismMk`: the class of a radical morphism, as a `k`-linear map.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismLift`: the universal property, a `k`-linear map out of the space
  from one on radical morphisms that kills the square of the radical, unique with its values by
  `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpace_linearMap_ext`.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpaceCongr`: the `k`-linear equivalence induced by a pair of
  isomorphisms of the source and the target.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismMk_eq_zero_iff`: a class vanishes exactly when its representative
  lies in the square of the radical, and `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismMk_eq_iff` the corresponding
  criterion for two classes to agree.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpace_linearMap_ext`: the uniqueness half of the universal
  property — a `k`-linear map out of the space is determined by its values on classes of radical
  morphisms.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismMk_ne_zero_iff`: **the detection statement** — between objects with
  local endomorphism rings a class is nonzero exactly when its representative is an irreducible
  morphism.
* `TauCeti.nontrivial_irreducibleMorphismSpace_iff` and
  `TauCeti.subsingleton_irreducibleMorphismSpace_iff`: the space is nontrivial exactly when an
  irreducible morphism exists, and vanishes exactly when none does.
* `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpaceCongr_refl`, `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpaceCongr_trans` and
  `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpaceCongr_symm`: the invariance is functorial in the two
  isomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.exists_isIrreducibleMorphism_irreducibleMorphismMk_eq`: every nonzero class is
  represented by an irreducible morphism.
* `TauCeti.finrank_irreducibleMorphismSpace_le`: over a division ring the space is no larger than
  the morphism space it is carved out of, and
  `TauCeti.finrank_irreducibleMorphismSpace_pos_iff` that its dimension is positive exactly when
  an irreducible morphism `X ⟶ Y` exists.

## Implementation notes

The quotient is formed inside the *submodule* `rad(X, Y)`, so its elements are classes of elements
of the subtype `↥(jacobsonRadicalSubmodule k X Y)`; every statement below is therefore phrased with
the underlying morphism `(f : X ⟶ Y)` of such an element, so that a caller never has to see the
subtype's own submodule, which is private.  The alternative, quotienting the whole morphism space by
`rad²`, is a different module — it has the non-radical morphisms in it as well — and is not what an
arrow of the Auslander-Reiten quiver counts.

`TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpace` is a plain `def` rather than an abbreviation, with its additive
and `k`-module structures transported by `inferInstanceAs`, so that the quotient is not unfolded by
`simp` in goals that mention it.  Its body is not exposed, and the submodule it divides by is
private, so that no caller depends on the subtype-quotient representation: the API below stands in
for Mathlib's quotient operations, with `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismMk` for
`Submodule.Quotient.mk`, `TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismMk_surjective` for quotient induction,
`TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismLift` for `Submodule.liftQ` and
`TauCeti.irreducibleMorphismSpace_linearMap_ext` for `Submodule.linearMap_qext`.

Conjugation by a pair of isomorphisms needs no quotient theory, so the equivalence of radicals it
induces, `TauCeti.jacobsonRadicalSubmoduleCongr`, lives with the radical itself in
`TauCeti.CategoryTheory.Preadditive.Radical.Basic`; the induced equivalence of quotients built here
is Mathlib's `Submodule.Quotient.equiv` applied to it.
