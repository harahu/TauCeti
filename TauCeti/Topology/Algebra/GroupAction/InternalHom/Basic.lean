# Conjugation actions on internal homs of discrete modules

Let a group `G` act on two additive monoids `M` and `N`. The additive homomorphisms
`M →+ N` carry the *conjugation* action

`homAction g φ : m ↦ g • φ (g⁻¹ • m)`,

which is the action for which evaluation `(φ, m) ↦ φ m` is equivariant, in the form
`homAction g φ (g • m) = g • φ m`. This file constructs that action and proves that it is again a
continuous action on a discrete module when `M` is finite discrete and `N` is discrete: the set of
group elements fixing a given `φ` is open, and over a compact `G` it contains an open normal
subgroup. The internal hom is contravariantly functorial in its source, by precomposition with an
equivariant homomorphism, and covariantly functorial in its target, by postcomposition; `Hom(-, N)`
is exact on the modules killed by a prime `p`, for every `N`: this is the algebra behind the dual
of a short exact sequence of finite `𝔽_p[G]`-modules.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.homAction`: the conjugation action of `G` on `M →+ N`, with the action laws
  `homAction_one` and `homAction_mul` and the additivity laws `homAction_zero`, `homAction_add`,
  `homAction_neg` and `homAction_sub`.
* `TauCeti.InternalHom`: the carrier `M →+ N` equipped with that action, as a `DistribMulAction`
  instance. Its `TauCeti.InternalHom.of` and `TauCeti.InternalHom.toAddMonoidHom` translate to and
  from `M →+ N`.
* `TauCeti.InternalHom.evalPairing`: the evaluation pairing, the additive homomorphism
  `InternalHom G M N →+ (M →+ N)` whose value at `φ` and `m` is the evaluation `φ m`; its
  equivariance is `TauCeti.InternalHom.evalPairing_equivariant`, and that of the opposite pairing
  `(m, φ) ↦ φ m` is `TauCeti.InternalHom.evalPairing_flip_equivariant`.
* `TauCeti.InternalHom.precomp`: precomposition with an equivariant homomorphism `f : M →+[G] M'`,
  the equivariant homomorphism `InternalHom G M' N →+[G] InternalHom G M N`, with
  `TauCeti.InternalHom.evalPairing_precomp` as its defining equation and the functor laws
  `precomp_id` and `precomp_comp`.
* `TauCeti.InternalHom.postcomp`: postcomposition with an equivariant homomorphism `f : N →+[G] N'`,
  the equivariant homomorphism `InternalHom G M N →+[G] InternalHom G M N'`, with
  `TauCeti.InternalHom.evalPairing_postcomp` as its defining equation and the functor laws
  `postcomp_id` and `postcomp_comp`.
* `TauCeti.InternalHom.restrict`: restriction of the acting group to a subgroup `U ≤ G`, the
  `U`-equivariant bijection `InternalHom G M N →+[U] InternalHom U M N` that leaves the underlying
  homomorphism unchanged.
* `TauCeti.InternalHom.zmodEquiv`: for a `ZMod n`-module `A`, evaluation at `1` identifies
  `InternalHom G (ZMod n) A` with `A` additively; `TauCeti.InternalHom.toAddMonoidHom_apply_eq_smul`
  recovers a homomorphism from its value at `1`. For a trivial action of `G` on `ZMod n`,
  evaluation at `1` is equivariant (`TauCeti.InternalHom.zmodEquiv_smul`); for trivial actions on
  both `M` and `N` the conjugation action on `InternalHom G M N` is trivial
  (`TauCeti.InternalHom.smul_eq_self_of_smul_eq_self`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.homAction_apply_smul`: evaluation is equivariant; on the carrier this is
  `TauCeti.InternalHom.evalPairing_equivariant`.
* `TauCeti.homAction_eq_self_iff`: `g` fixes `φ` exactly when `φ` commutes with the action of `g`
  (`TauCeti.InternalHom.smul_eq_self_iff` on the carrier); so `φ` is fixed by all of `G` exactly
  when it is `G`-equivariant (`TauCeti.forall_homAction_eq_self_iff`, and
  `TauCeti.InternalHom.mem_fixedPoints_iff` on the carrier).
* `TauCeti.isOpen_setOfPred_homAction_eq_self`: for finite `M` and discrete `N` the set of group
  elements fixing a continuous `φ` is open. This is what the `ContinuousSMul G` instance on
  `TauCeti.InternalHom` rests on; with the discrete topology that carrier has by definition, it is
  what makes it again a discrete `G`-module for finite discrete `M` and discrete `N`.
* `TauCeti.exists_openNormalSubgroup_homAction_eq_self`: over a compact topological group that
  set contains an open normal subgroup.
* `TauCeti.InternalHom.precomp_injective`, `TauCeti.InternalHom.exact_precomp`,
  `TauCeti.InternalHom.precomp_surjective` and `TauCeti.InternalHom.precomp_surjective_of_baer`:
  `Hom(-, N)` takes a surjection to an injection, an exact pair with surjective second map to an
  exact pair, and an injection to a surjection when the target of the injection is killed by a
  prime `p`, or is killed by `n` with `N` satisfying Baer's criterion over `ℤ/nℤ`; both are cases of
  `TauCeti.InternalHom.precomp_surjective_of_forall_exists_comp_eq`, precomposition is surjective
  as soon as every additive homomorphism extends. The internal hom of finite modules is finite, and
  it is killed by any natural number killing the codomain (`TauCeti.InternalHom.nsmul_eq_zero`) or
  the domain (`TauCeti.InternalHom.nsmul_eq_zero_of_domain`).
* `TauCeti.InternalHom.postcomp_injective`, `TauCeti.InternalHom.postcomp_bijective` and
  `TauCeti.InternalHom.postcomp_bijective_of_forall_nsmul_eq_zero`: `Hom(M, -)` takes an injection
  to an injection and an isomorphism to an isomorphism, and, when `M` is killed by `n`, it takes an
  injection whose range is the `n`-torsion of its target to an isomorphism.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib already puts the codomain-pointwise action `(g • φ) m = g • φ m` on `M →+ N`, as the
instance in `Mathlib/Algebra/GroupWithZero/Action/Hom.lean`, and that action is not the conjugation
one, so the conjugation action cannot be registered on `M →+ N` itself: instance search would be
incoherent, and continuous cohomology of `M →+ N` would silently pick up the pointwise action.
The conjugation action is therefore introduced twice over. It is first the plain function
`homAction` of `g`, whose action and additivity laws are the lemmas listed above; this is the
form used by the lemmas about evaluation. It is
assembled from Mathlib's `DistribSMul.toAddMonoidHom`, which bundles each `g • ·` as an additive
homomorphism, so that its additivity comes from `AddMonoidHom.comp`. It is then registered as a
genuine `DistribMulAction` on the wrapper `InternalHom G M N`, which is the object downstream
cohomology is meant to be applied to. The two actions on `M →+ N` agree at any `g` acting trivially
on the source (`homAction_eq_smul_of_smul_eq_self`).

The group `G` is a phantom parameter of `InternalHom G M N`: the type of its single field does not
mention `G`, so it is formed for bare additive monoids, and `Group G` and the two
`DistribMulAction`s are hypotheses of the action instances only, as `AddCommMonoid N` is a
hypothesis of the additive ones. The additive structure is transported from `M →+ N` along the
`of`/`toAddMonoidHom` equivalence, as an `AddCommMonoid` in general and as an `AddCommGroup` when
`N` is one. That equivalence is written inline in the two instances rather than given a name, so
that the only bundled form of the carrier map in the public surface is `evalPairing`; the
transported structure is meant to be used only through the interface lemmas below
(`toAddMonoidHom_zero`, `toAddMonoidHom_add`, `toAddMonoidHom_nsmul`, `of_zero`, `of_add`,
`of_nsmul` and their group-level counterparts), which hold by `rfl` on the transported instance.

Two theorems are instead written `(rfl)` rather than `rfl`: `homAction_apply` and
`evalPairing_apply`. The module system rejects a bare `rfl` for an *exported* theorem whose proof
unfolds a definition that is not `@[expose]`d, and those two unfold `homAction` and `evalPairing`,
which nothing here needs to be exposed. The parenthesized form elaborates the same proof as an
ordinary term, without that check.

Continuity in the group variable (`continuous_homAction_apply`) needs only that `φ` itself be
continuous, the two actions occurring in `g • φ (g⁻¹ • m)` being continuous by hypothesis, and
`isOpen_setOfPred_homAction_eq_self` inherits that hypothesis; the discrete source of the intended
setting enters only where it is discharged, in the `ContinuousSMul` instance, by
`continuous_of_discreteTopology`.

`Representation.linHom` is the same conjugation construction for `k`-linear maps `V →ₗ[k] W` of
bundled representations. It is not used as the definition here for two reasons. Its carrier is
`V →ₗ[k] W`, a type distinct from the `M →+ N` used for additive cochains, so
routing through it would still need a bespoke definition round-tripping along
`AddMonoidHom.toIntLinearMap` and `LinearMap.toAddMonoidHom`; and taking `k = ℤ` forces
`Module ℤ M` and `Module ℤ N`, hence `AddCommGroup` on both sides, whereas everything below needs
only `AddMonoid M` and `AddMonoid N`. In the generality where `Representation.linHom` is available
the two constructions do agree, transported along `AddMonoidHom.toIntLinearMap`; that comparison is
not recorded here, because it would pull `Mathlib.RepresentationTheory.Basic` — and with it the
tensor, matrix and dual stack — into a file the whole continuous-cohomology development imports.

Mathlib puts no topology on `M →+ N`. Discreteness of the internal hom enters here through the
discreteness of the ambient function space `M → N`, which is what
`isOpen_setOfPred_homAction_eq_self` rests on. `InternalHom G M N` carries the discrete topology by
definition, with no hypothesis on `M` or `N`: that is the intended topology in the discrete setting
this file is written for, namely finite discrete `M` and discrete `N`, which is also the setting in
which the action is proved continuous below. Those hypotheses are sufficient for that continuity,
not necessary — if `G` acts trivially on both `M` and `N` then it acts trivially on `M →+ N`, so
the action is continuous for an infinite `M` too — and it is sufficiency that is established here.
(A trivial action on `M` alone does not suffice: the stabilizer of `φ` is then the intersection of
the stabilizers of the values `φ m`, which for infinitely many `m` need not be open.) For infinite
`M` the internal hom in the category of discrete `G`-modules is the sub-object of homomorphisms
with open stabilizer, which is not `InternalHom G M N`; nothing here claims otherwise.
