# Pro-`p` groups are closed under extensions

Let `f : E →* G` be a continuous surjection from a compact group with continuous multiplication onto
a Hausdorff group. If `G` is pro-`p` and the kernel of `f` is pro-`p` in the subspace topology, then
`E` is pro-`p` (`TauCeti.IsProP.of_ker_isProP`). The finite input is that an extension of a
`p`-group by a `p`-group is a `p`-group, `IsPGroup.comap_of_ker_isPGroup`. The topological input is
that a continuous surjection from a compact group onto a Hausdorff group is an open map, so the
image of an open normal subgroup `U ≤ E` is an open normal subgroup `f(U) ≤ G`; this exhibits
`E ⧸ U` as an extension of the finite `p`-group `G ⧸ f(U)` by a quotient of the kernel.

For an extension `1 → M → E → G → 1` of topological groups with compact total group, this says that
`E` is pro-`p` as soon as `M` and `G` are (`GroupExtension.isProP`). It is what makes the universal
property of a free pro-`p` group available for lifting generators through such an extension.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsProP.of_ker_isProP`: a compact group mapping onto a Hausdorff pro-`p` group by a
  continuous surjection with pro-`p` kernel is pro-`p`.
* `GroupExtension.isProP`: the total group of an extension of a pro-`p` group by a pro-`p` group is
  pro-`p`.
